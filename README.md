# SCTP_project_2


GIT (GIT is a software)
- Version Control Software

GITHUB (not the same as GIT; GITHUB is a company)

- git add <file_name>
- git status (git is holding this file for us and waiting for us to commit/confirm this change)
- git commit -m "<commit_message>" (what is the descriptive message of summarizing the changes?)
- git push

Your branch is ahead of 'origin/main' by 1 commit. => ur local copy has 1 change compared to the github one.

- Should do small commits, at least we know where the error happens.
